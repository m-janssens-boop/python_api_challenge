# python_api_challenge
This program consists of two parts, WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. 

WeatherPy.ipynb: this script calls weather data from the openweathermap API, converts it into a dataframe, and uses scatter plots and linear regression to compare various aspects of weather with cities across the globe.

VacationPy.ipynb: this script takes the cities_df created in WeatherPy.ipynb and uses the geoapify API to search for hotels within a given radius from specific cities that meet particular weather criteria. It then plots that data into interactive map plots.
